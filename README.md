# LiveWallpapers
Looped videos of iOS Live Wallpapers â€” apply to your jailbroken home screen for a cool look

# How to Apply
* On your iOS device, open this repo in Safari and find the wallpaper you'd like.
* Tap **Download** on its page. When the video opens in Safari, tap **Share** and **Save to Files**. It's best that you save it to *'On My iPhone'*.
* Open your package manager and add the source **[https://zerui18.github.io/zxo2](https://zerui18.github.io/zxo2)**.
* Open the source and install **Frame**, or **Frame Legacy** if you're using an older software version.
* Once installed, find Frame in Settings. Make sure it's enabled and choose your settings.
* Tap **Choose Wallpapers**, **Choose Video**, and **Files**.
* Navigate to the video you downloaded. It may be quicker to find it in Recents.
* Tap on the thumbnail of the video and select if you'd like it on your Lock Screen or Home Screen.

**That's it!** Enjoy your new wallpapers.

# Please Note
I did not develop the tweak. I have simply produced the looping wallpapers using the existing Live wallpapers in iOS. The tweak was made by [Zerui18](https://github.com/zerui18/Frame).
